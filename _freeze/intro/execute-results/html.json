Data science is a vast field, and there's no way you can master it all by reading a single book. This book aims to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary. Our model of the steps of a typical data science project looks something like @fig-ds-diagram.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![In our model of the data science process, you start with data import\nand tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of\ntransforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process\nby communicating your results to other humans.\n](diagrams/base.png){#fig-ds-diagram fig-alt='A diagram displaying the data science cycle: Import -> Tidy -> Understand\n(which has the phases Transform -> Visualize -> Model in a cycle) ->\nCommunicate. Surrounding all of these is Program.\n'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter reading this book, you'll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challenges using the following skills:\n\n-   The ability to import and explore data using R\n\n-   A solid understanding of basic statistics and machine learning concepts\n\n-   The ability to clean and wrangle data using packages like dplyr and tidyr\n\n-   The ability to visualize data using ggplot2\n\n-   The ability to build machine learning models to predict outcomes or find patterns in data\n\n-   The ability to apply unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and anomaly detection\n\n-   An understanding of advanced topics like natural language processing (NLP) and image processing\n\n-   The ability to work with big data and scale their analysis using cloud computing platforms\n\n-   The ability to apply their skills to a real-world data science project\n\n-   An understanding of time series analysis and reinforcement learning\n\n## How this book is organized\n\nBelow is a list of items we are going to cover in this book:\n1.  Introduction to Data Science and R\n2.  Data Exploration and Visualization\n3.  Supervised Learning\n4.  Unsupervised Learning\n5.  Boosting and Random Forest\n6.  Natural Language Processing\n7.  Image Processing/Computer Vision\n8.  Reinforcement Learning\n9.  Big Data & Cloud Computing\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis book isn't just the product of the listed authors but is the result of many conversations (in person and online) that we've had with many people in the R community.\nWe're incredibly grateful for all the conversations we've had with y'all; Thank You So Much!",
