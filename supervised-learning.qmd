-   In @sec-basics-supervised-learning we will get to understand the basics of supervised learning from a theoretical and practical standpoint.

-   In @sec-linear-reg we will dive into linear regression from a theoretical and practical standpoint.

-   In @sec-k-nearest-neighbour-reg we will understand the k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) regression algorithm as a classic method for nonlinear data..

-   In @sec-class-log-reg we will dive into classification models.
