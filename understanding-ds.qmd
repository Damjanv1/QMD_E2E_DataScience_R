## State of Data Science

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves using scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It involves collecting and processing large amounts of data, analyzing it to identify patterns and trends, and using those insights to make informed business decisions. A Data Scientist is a professional who has expertise in data analysis, machine learning, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge. They use various statistical and computational techniques to analyse large, complex datasets and derive valuable insights that help organisations make informed decisions. It can be used to optimize operations, improve customer experiences, and develop new products and services. By leveraging Data Science techniques, businesses can gain a competitive edge by making more informed decisions and quickly adapting to changing market conditions.

Data Science involves several stages, including data collection, data cleaning, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modelling, and evaluation. Data Scientists work with various tools and technologies such as Python, R, SQL, Hadoop, Spark, and Tableau, to name a few.

## Difference among popular data careers?

While Data Science is a broad field, there are several roles that one can pursue within it. Here are some of the key differences between Data Engineer, Data Analyst, BI Analyst, and Statistician:
