## What you will learn

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. Data science is a vast field, and there's no way you can master it all by reading a single book. This book aims to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary. Our model of the steps of a typical data science project looks something like @fig-ds-diagram.

```{r}
#| label: fig-ds-diagram
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   In our model of the data science process, you start with data import
#|   and tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of
#|   transforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process 
#|   by communicating your results to other humans.

#|   Communicate. Surrounding all of these is Program.

After reading this book, you'll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challenges using the following skills:

-   The ability to import and explore data using R

-   A solid understanding of basic statistics and machine learning concepts

-   The ability to clean and wrangle data using packages like dplyr and tidyr

-   The ability to visualize data using ggplot2

-   The ability to build machine learning models to predict outcomes or find patterns in data

-   The ability to apply unsupervised learning techniques like clustering and anomaly detection

-   An understanding of advanced topics like natural language processing (NLP) and image processing

-   The ability to work with big data and scale their analysis using cloud computing platforms

-   The ability to apply their skills to a real-world data science project

-   An understanding of time series analysis and reinforcement learning
