In this fourth part of the book, our focus will be on the the five following chapters:

-   In @sec-basic-unsupervised-learning we will get to understand the basics of unsupervised learning from a theoretical and practical standpoint..

-   In @sec-k-means-clust we will explore clustering techniques and their implementation using `R`.

-   In @sec-hier-clust we will explore hierarchical clustering techniques and its implementation using `R`.

-   In @sec-pca we will understand PCA and its implementation using `R`..

-   In @sec-t-sne we will dive t-SNE and its implementation using `R`..
